# BQSim: GPU-accelerated Batch Quantum Circuit Simulation using Decision Diagram

![BQSim](bqsim.png)

This Artifact describes the steps to compile and run `BQSim` on various quantum circuits and provides a performance comparison of `BQSim` against `cuQuantum`, `Qiskit Aer`, and `FlatDD`, reproducing the runtime results from Section 4.2 and Section 4.5. 

The artifact includes the source code for `BQSim`, `cuQuantum`, `Qiskit Aer`, and `FlatDD`, along with 16 quantum circuits and their corresponding inputs with varying numbers of qubits for evaluation. Running the artifact requires a CUDA-enabled GPU with at least 48 GB of memory, 20 GB of system RAM, and 20 GB of free disk space.

## Artifact check-list (meta-information)

* Compilation: GCC 12.3.0, NVCC 12.6, CMake 3.22.1 (Without Docker container). Alternatively, we also provide a Dockerfile in our artifact. We provide an automated compilation script and a Dockerfile.
* Datasets: 16 quantum circuits in `circuits/`, and the corresponding random circuit inputs.
* Hardware: CUDA-enabled GPU with 48 GB of memory and 20 GB of system RAM.
* Metrics: Simulation runtime.
* Output: Metric data in the console log. 
* Experiments: We provide automated scripts for running the experiments.
* Disk space: 20 GB.
* How much time is needed to prepare workflow (approximately)?: 10 minutes.

* How much time is needed to complete experiments (approximately)?: For Section 4.2, all experiments take approximately four days to complete, as demonstrated in Section 4.2. To reduce runtime, we can evaluate each simulator separately. The fastest simulator, `BQSim`, takes less than 20 minutes, whereas the slowest simulator, `FlatDD`, takes more than two days. For Section 4.5, the experiments take approximately 10 minutes to complete.
## Description

1. Hardware dependencies: An x86 host with a CUDA-enabled GPU (at least 48 GB of memory), 20 GB of system RAM, and 20 GB of free disk space.

2. Software dependencies: Our experiments are conducted on a Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS machine with the following software dependencies:

**Without Docker**

* CUDA 12.6 with cuQuantum SDK.
* GCC 12.3.0, NVCC 12.6, CMake 3.22.1.
* libeigen3-dev.
* OpenMP.
* Python 3.10.12 with NumPy 1.26.4, Qiskit Aer GPU 0.15.0, and Qiskit 1.2.0.

**With Docker**

* Docker 26.1.3.
* [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html). Installation can be verified by running `nvidia-container-cli --version`. 

3. Datasets: The artifact includes 16 `MQT-Bench` quantum circuits along with their corresponding randomly generated inputs.

## Compilation

**Without Docker**

Run the compilation script `compile.sh`, which will automatically generate the executables for `BQSim` and the baseline simulators (`cuQuantum` and `FlatDD`, `Qiskit Aer` is provided as a Python file).

`~/BQSim$ ./compile.sh`

**With Docker**

Build a docker image `bqsim_image` using `Dockerfile`.  The compilation script `docker_compile.sh` is included in the Dockerfile, so if the Docker image builds successfully, the program should compile without issues. 

`~/BQSim$ sudo docker build --no-cache -t bqsim_image . `

Run a docker container `bqsim_container` using the image.

`~/BQSim$ sudo docker run -it --rm --gpus all --name bqsim_container bqsim_image:latest`

To confirm that the container can access the GPU, run inside the container:

`/workspace/BQSim# nvidia-smi`

If it fails, the host system is not passing the GPU properly.

## Experiment workflow

After compilation, we execute the automated scripts to run `BQSim`, `cuQuantum`, `Qiskit Aer`, and `FlatDD` on 16 quantum circuits. The scripts report the runtime of each simulator for each circuit.

## Evaluation and expected results

### Section 4.2: Overall comparison

To execute simulators `BQSim`, `cuQuantum`, `Qiskit Aer`, and `FlatDD` on 16 quantum circuits, we run the `overall.sh` script. Since the output may contain many lines, it is redirected to a log file, `overall.txt`, located in `log/outputs/`. Both inside and outside the Docker container, the same general steps apply here.

**Without Docker**

`~/BQSim$ ./overall.sh > log/outputs/overall.txt`

**With Docker**

`/workspace/BQSim# ./overall.sh > log/outputs/overall.txt`

However, this process takes approximately four days. To reduce the runtime, we can evaluate each simulator separately by running individual scripts:

* `BQSim`: `bqsim.sh`
* `cuQuantum`: `cuquantum.sh`
* `Qiskit Aer`: `qiskit-aer.sh`
* `FlatDD`: `flatdd.sh`

The fastest simulator, BQSim, takes less than 20 minutes, whereas the slowest simulator, FlatDD, takes more than two days. Each simulator can be run independently with the following commands, and the simulation runtime will be recorded in respective log files:

**Without Docker**

`~/BQSim$ ./bqsim.sh > log/outputs/bqsim.txt`

`~/BQSim$ ./cuquantum.sh > log/outputs/cuquantum.txt`

`~/BQSim$ ./qiskit-aer.sh > log/outputs/qiskit-aer.txt`

`~/BQSim$ ./flatdd.sh > log/outputs/flatdd.txt`

**With Docker**

`/workspace/BQSim# ./bqsim.sh > log/outputs/bqsim.txt`

`/workspace/BQSim# ./cuquantum.sh > log/outputs/cuquantum.txt`

`/workspace/BQSim# ./qiskit-aer.sh > log/outputs/qiskit-aer.txt`

`/workspace/BQSim# ./flatdd.sh > log/outputs/flatdd.txt`

#### How to read the log files:

* `BQSim`: Look for the field `"simulation_time":`.
* `cuQuantum`: Look for the field `cuQuantum runtime:`.
* `Qiskit Aer` and `FlatDD`: Look for the field `============Execution time in ms:`.

### Section 4.5: Evaluation of Task Graph-based Execution

The same general steps apply to experiments both inside and outside the Docker container.

**Exporting fused gates in Docker**

We export the fused gates obtained from BQCS-aware gate fusion and Qiskit Aer's gate fusion by running script `export_fused_gates.sh` in the Docker container.

`/workspace/BQSim# ./export_fused_gates.sh`

This script will export the fused gates in `log/fused_gates/`, where some pre-exported fused gates are already provided.  Due to memory and time constraints, we did not export all the fused gates analyzed in Section 4.5. You may modify `export_fused_gates.sh` to export additional gates as needed.

**Running cuQuantum with fused gates in Docker**

We run cuQuantum with both our BQCS-aware gate-fusion (i.e., `cuQuantum+B`) and Qiskit Aer’s gate-fusion (i.e., `cuQuantum+Q`) algorithms by executing script `cuquantum_plus_bq.sh` in the Docker container.

`/workspace/BQSim# ./cuquantum_plus_bq.sh`
